I will use android studio for this project.


I would like to design a game which performs a 2d platform concept. We all familiar with game “Super Mario. Recently I have experienced an indie game which called “Inside”.  The difference that “Inside” is a very recent game comparing to the “Super Mario”. The character does not only move across the left and right of the screen but also up and down. By “Up” and “Down” I don’t mean just jumping to the platforms. There are bunch of different layers. We can interact with objects around the screen. Furthermore, the map adapts changes. If the player breaks a door that place adjust itself and save the current state.  

I plan on adding arrow and interact keys right and left bottom of the screen that depends on the user’s selection. The user can be both right-handed or left-handed so in my options bar user can adjust the locations of the buttons. 

I would like to change the background and surroundings in terms of the environment depending on each level. At each level once the player goes further the game would be much harder. 
The ultimate goal is to achieve the “Exit” of the maze by solving tasks and puzzles. Once the player reaches the goal there should be a reward at the end of each level such as speed or jump boost. I plan having obstacles and enemies which tries to prevent our character. At each level the number and the capabilities would be increase. 

I need to design my main class as having the layout for the maze and our character’s image. I need to include obstacles and enemies in my main class so with the “IF” blocks I would be able to identify the current situation. 
I would also set “onclick listeners” in my main activity.java so I can determine what happens once the user interacts with the buttons. 
I would also include an if block that whether checks the player has reached the goal or not.
 With each level the environments should change and adapt. So I need another sessions for every level. 
The game should not be and old-fashioned model like the 90s games. The users should not start from the beginning once she/he fails. Hence it should be a modern approach and has multiple checkpoints. 
 I would also add another class for dealing the menu. In menu there should be an options section. Therefore, I need methods for the option segment. The user can adjust the location of the buttons so my menu class should interact with my Activity_main.xml file.
